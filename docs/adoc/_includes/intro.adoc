== Introduction

Blob Stores are used to store (large) files in the cloud.
Amdatu Blob Stores is based on the jclouds library that supports Blob Stores from several cloud providers such as Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure.
The Blob Stores component makes the jclouds API available as OSGi service using a Managed Service Factory.
This way you can use Configuration Admin to configure Blob Stores while using the jclouds API to use the Blob Stores from code.
